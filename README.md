# MedaPath

**AI-Powered Healthcare Navigation**

MedaPath is an intelligent healthcare triage and navigation platform that helps patients understand their symptoms, find the right care, and make informed decisions — all powered by Google's Gemini AI.

Built for the hackathon by **Raphael Omorose** and **Uyiosa Nehikhuere**.

## What It Does

MedaPath guides patients through a seamless journey from symptom intake to finding the right hospital:

### 1. Patient Intake
Patients enter their personal information, ZIP code, and insurance details. The app auto-detects location using the Google Geocoding API to pre-fill the ZIP code, and presents a curated list of real insurance providers and plan names for accurate matching.

### 2. Symptom Assessment
Patients describe their symptoms in plain language, select severity and duration, and can optionally upload photos or videos of affected areas. Supported formats include JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, MP4, MOV, and WebM — all sent securely to the AI for visual analysis.

### 3. AI-Powered Diagnosis
Google Gemini AI analyzes the patient's symptoms (and uploaded images) to provide:
- A **primary condition** identified in plain, easy-to-understand language
- **Three possible conditions** the symptoms could indicate
- An **urgency level** (low, medium, high, emergency)
- **Actionable advice** — what to do right now and when to see a doctor
- A **detailed explanation** of what's likely happening in the body, written as if explaining to a friend
- **Recommended care type** (Primary Care, Urgent Care, Emergency Room, or Specialist)

If Gemini is unavailable, a built-in keyword-based triage engine provides fallback analysis covering 12+ common conditions.

### 4. Hospital Matching
The platform finds the best nearby hospitals by combining:
- **Google Places API** to discover real hospitals near any ZIP code in the US
- **Insurance network matching** against a database of 15 Atlanta-area hospitals with detailed plan-level data
- **Smart scoring** that weighs insurance match, care type fit, distance, and emergency capability
- **Google Gemini AI coverage analysis** that evaluates whether each hospital is likely covered by the patient's specific insurance plan
- **Google Maps** for an interactive map view with custom markers, distance display, and one-click calling

### 5. Live AI Chat (Flagship Feature)
After receiving their diagnosis, patients can have a **real-time conversation with Gemini AI** to ask follow-up questions like:
- "Can I take ibuprofen with this?"
- "What home remedies might help?"
- "When should I go to the ER?"
- "Is this contagious?"

The AI assistant has full context of the patient's symptoms, diagnosis, and medical history from the session. It maintains multi-turn conversation history and provides warm, conversational responses while always reminding patients to seek professional medical advice.

### 6. Save & Download Reports
Patients can download a professionally formatted **Analysis Report** as a printable HTML document containing their full intake information, symptom details, AI diagnosis, urgency level, and care recommendations — perfect for sharing with a doctor at check-in.

## APIs & Services Used

### Google Gemini AI (`gemini-3-flash-preview`)

Gemini is the core intelligence behind MedaPath. We use it in **four distinct ways** across the app:

1. **Symptom Analysis & Triage** — When a patient submits their symptoms, Gemini receives the symptom description, severity, and duration. It returns a structured JSON response with the likely condition, three possible conditions, urgency level, plain-language advice, a detailed body-level explanation, and a recommended care type. The prompt instructs Gemini to respond as a "friendly medical triage assistant" using everyday language, not medical jargon.

2. **Medical Image Understanding** — When a patient uploads a photo or video of the affected area, the image is base64-encoded and sent to Gemini as an inline multimodal input (image placed before text per Gemini's documentation for optimal results). Gemini analyzes the visual content alongside the symptom text and returns an `imageNote` describing what it observes in the image in plain language.

3. **Insurance Coverage Verification** — After hospitals are matched, Gemini receives the list of top hospitals along with the patient's insurance provider, plan name, and diagnosed condition. It generates a one-sentence coverage insight for each hospital, explaining whether the patient's plan would likely cover treatment there. This gives patients practical, actionable insurance guidance without needing to call their insurer.

4. **Live Follow-Up Chat** — After diagnosis, patients can chat with Gemini in a multi-turn conversation. The AI receives the full patient context (name, age, symptoms, diagnosis, urgency, advice) as a system prompt, then maintains conversation history across messages. Patients can ask things like "Can I take ibuprofen?", "Is this contagious?", or "What should I tell the doctor?" — and Gemini responds conversationally while always reminding them to seek professional advice.

### Google Places API (Nearby Search)

When a patient enters a ZIP code outside our seed data coverage area (Atlanta), the backend calls the Places API Nearby Search endpoint to find real hospitals within a 10-mile radius of the geocoded ZIP coordinates. The response includes hospital names, addresses, coordinates, ratings, and open/closed status — all displayed on the map and in the list view.

### Google Geocoding API

Used in two directions:
- **Forward geocoding (ZIP to coordinates):** When the patient submits the intake form, the backend geocodes their ZIP code to latitude/longitude. These coordinates drive the hospital distance calculations and map centering.
- **Reverse geocoding (coordinates to ZIP):** When the patient grants browser location access, the frontend reverse-geocodes their coordinates to auto-fill the ZIP code field for convenience.

### Google Maps JavaScript API

Powers the interactive hospital map on the Results page. Custom SVG pin markers show numbered hospitals (with the top match in a larger pin), a blue dot marks the patient's ZIP code center, and the map auto-fits bounds to show all markers. Clicking a marker selects that hospital and shows its details in a side panel.
